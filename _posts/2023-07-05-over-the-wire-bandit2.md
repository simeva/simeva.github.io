### Level 10>11

Task: The password for the next level is stored in the file `data.txt`, which contains `base64` encoded data

> Decoding using base64 command

```console
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 data.txt -d
The password is 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM
bandit10@bandit:~$
```
### Level 11>12

Task: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

> Using the `tr` command we can translate the data in data.txt using the ROT13 format.

```console
bandit11@bandit:~$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
The password is JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv
bandit11@bandit:~$
```

### Level 12>13

Task: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

> Tricky ! Exploring the different compression/decompresson tools.

```console
bandit12@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/sime/
bandit12@bandit:~$ cp data.txt /tmp/sime/
bandit12@bandit:~$ mv /tmp/sime/data.txt /tmp/sime/file.txt
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/sime

### Level 13>14

Task: The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

> `ssh --help` listed how to use ssh with an `identity` file (private key).

```console
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
ssh -i /home/bandit13/sshkey.private  bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220
The authenticity of host '[bandit.labs.overthewire.org]:2220 ([127.0.0.1]:2220)' can't be established.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

### Level 14>15

Task: The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

> `Telnet` to `localhost`, enter password from prev level. Success!

```console
bandit14@bandit:~$ telnet localhost 30000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
Correct!
